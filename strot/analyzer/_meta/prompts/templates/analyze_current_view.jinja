TASK: Extract text sections from webpage screenshot that match the user's data scraping requirement.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ONLY extract text sections that are DIRECTLY RELEVANT to the user requirement
2. Text sections must be EXACT MATCHES visible in the screenshot
3. Each text entry should not be more than 15 words
4. These text sections will be used to find matching AJAX API responses

WHAT TO EXTRACT:
- Product names, prices, descriptions, reviews, titles, etc. (actual data content)
- Text that represents the specific data the user wants to scrape

WHAT TO IGNORE:
- Headers, footers, breadcrumbs
- Login/signup forms, search bars, generic buttons
- Advertisements, cookie banners, unrelated content

ACTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM (ORDERED BY PRIORITY):
1. If you find pagination controls (Next, More, page numbers) that could load more relevant content:
   → Set "load_more_content_coords" to the pagination element coordinates
   → Leave other fields null

2. If you find relevant text sections:
   → Set "text_sections" to the list of extracted text
   → Leave coordinate fields null

3. If you see an overlay popup (cookie banner, newsletter signup, login modal) that blocks content (Ignore If popup body contains relevant content):
   → Set "close_overlay_popup_coords" to the dismiss/close button coordinates
   → Leave other fields null

4. If you find a clickable element or button that could lead to page sections likely containing relevant content:
   → Set "skip_to_content_coords" to the element coordinates
   → Leave other fields null
